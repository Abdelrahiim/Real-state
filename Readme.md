# MERN Real State Project

While I am using the Bun JavaScript runtime environment instead of Node.js, I will be referring to my project as a MERN
stack application. This is because the acronym is more catchy and professional, and because the MERN stack is still a
widely recognized and accepted term for JavaScript-based web development.

Although Bun is a newer technology, it is fully compatible with Node.js modules, so I am able to use all of the same
libraries and frameworks that I would use with a traditional MERN stack application. This means that my project will
still benefit from all of the advantages of the MERN stack, such as its speed, scalability, and large community of
developers.

I believe that it is important to use clear and concise language when communicating with other professionals. By
sticking with the MERN acronym, I am able to avoid confusion and make it easier for others to understand my project.
